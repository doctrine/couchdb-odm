Changed Annotation Indexing notation
------------------------------------

The notation to index a class or property as searchable through a repository using a CouchDB
view has changed from:

    /** @Document(indexed=true) */
    class User
    {
        /** @Field(indexed=true) */
        private $username;
    }

to:

    /** @Document @Index */
    class User
    {
        /** @Field @Index */
        private $username;
    }

Upgrade from Alpha 1 to Alpha2

Metadata Document representation changed
----------------------------------------

The Metadata representation of Doctrine mapped CouchDB documents changed significantly.
To migrate your old data you have to call:

    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:migrate "Doctrine\ODM\CouchDB\Tools\Migrations\Alpha2Migration"

To make this work you have to put your own doctrine-couchdb.php in your project. You can copy
it from bin/ or sandbox/ folders of the CouchDB migration. Make sure to also ship a cli-config.php
script like shown in the sandbox/cli-config.php

To migrate your doctrine associations and repositories, call:

    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:odm:update-design-doc doctrine_associations
    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:odm:update-design-doc doctrine_repositories
